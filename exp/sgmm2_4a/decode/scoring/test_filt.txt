JonnyGutteridge-20081120-hav-b0041 DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
JonnyGutteridge-20081120-hav-b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
JonnyGutteridge-20081120-hav-b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
JonnyGutteridge-20081120-hav-b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
JonnyGutteridge-20081120-hav-b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
JonnyGutteridge-20081120-hav-b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
JonnyGutteridge-20081120-hav-b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
JonnyGutteridge-20081120-hav-b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
JonnyGutteridge-20081120-hav-b0049 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
JonnyGutteridge-20081120-hav-b0050 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
Keren-20080605-cps-a0376 YOUR PRICE MY SON IS JUST ABOUT THIRTY PER WEEK
Keren-20080605-cps-a0377 THIS SOUND DID NOT DISTURB THE HUSH AND AWE OF THE PLACE
Keren-20080605-cps-a0378 THAT'S WHY ITS BOUNDARIES ARE ALL GOUGED AND JAGGED
Keren-20080605-cps-a0379 HOW OLD ARE YOU DADDY
Keren-20080605-cps-a0380 BUT IN THE CANYONS WATER WAS PLENTIFUL AND ALSO A LUXURIANT FOREST GROWTH
Keren-20080605-cps-a0381 MY NAME'S FERGUSON
Keren-20080605-cps-a0382 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
Keren-20080605-cps-a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
Keren-20080605-cps-a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
Keren-20080605-cps-a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
Keren-20080605-uzd-a0451 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
Keren-20080605-uzd-a0452 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
Keren-20080605-uzd-a0453 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
Keren-20080605-uzd-a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
Keren-20080605-uzd-a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
Keren-20080605-uzd-a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
Keren-20080605-uzd-a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
Keren-20080605-uzd-a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
Keren-20080605-uzd-a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
Keren-20080605-uzd-a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
Keren-20080605-vdf-b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
Keren-20080605-vdf-b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
Keren-20080605-vdf-b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
Keren-20080605-vdf-b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
Keren-20080605-vdf-b0072 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
Keren-20080605-vdf-b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
Keren-20080605-vdf-b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
Keren-20080605-vdf-b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
Keren-20080605-vdf-b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
Keren-20080605-vdf-b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
Ronin_Sage-20080110-ny-rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
Ronin_Sage-20080110-ny-rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
Ronin_Sage-20080110-ny-rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
Ronin_Sage-20080110-ny-rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
Ronin_Sage-20080110-ny-rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
Ronin_Sage-20080110-ny-rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
Ronin_Sage-20080110-ny-rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
Ronin_Sage-20080110-ny-rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
Ronin_Sage-20080110-ny-rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
Ronin_Sage-20080110-ny-rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
anonymous0046-20080428-cxb-b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
anonymous0046-20080428-cxb-b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
anonymous0046-20080428-cxb-b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
anonymous0046-20080428-cxb-b0114 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE
anonymous0046-20080428-cxb-b0115 FOR TWO HOURS NOT A WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
anonymous0046-20080428-cxb-b0116 I HAVE HUNTED ALONG THIS RIDGE REPLIED PHILIP
anonymous0046-20080428-cxb-b0117 THAT'S THORPE'S SAID THE YOUNG ENGINEER
anonymous0046-20080428-cxb-b0118 WE SAW YOUR LIGHT AND THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T MIND A CALL
anonymous0046-20080428-cxb-b0119 BILLINGER MAY ARRIVE IN TIME
anonymous0046-20080428-cxb-b0120 THERE'S THE HITCH REPLIED THORPE ROLLING A CIGARETTE
anonymous0122-20081010-uhe-b0491 JACOB BRINKER WHO WAS HIS ROADMATE BROUGHT THE NEWS
anonymous0122-20081010-uhe-b0492 THUS HE TURNED THE TENETS AND JARGON OF PSYCHOLOGY BACK ON ME
anonymous0122-20081010-uhe-b0493 YOU YELLOW GIANT THING OF THE FROST
anonymous0122-20081010-uhe-b0494 NEVER SO STRANGE A PROPHET CAME UP TO JERUSALEM
anonymous0122-20081010-uhe-b0495 WE WHO HAVE ENDURED SO MUCH SURELY CAN ENDURE A LITTLE MORE
anonymous0122-20081010-uhe-b0496 I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THAT ONE MAN CONTEMPLATED BY PASCAL'S PHILOSOPHIC EYE
anonymous0122-20081010-uhe-b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
anonymous0122-20081010-uhe-b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
anonymous0122-20081010-uhe-b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
anonymous0122-20081010-uhe-b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE
anonymous0155-20081116-pfp-b0064 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
anonymous0155-20081116-pfp-b0065 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP
anonymous0155-20081116-pfp-b0066 IF I MEET HER AGAIN I SHALL APOLOGIZE SAID EILEEN
anonymous0155-20081116-pfp-b0067 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
anonymous0155-20081116-pfp-b0068 ONLY THE CHANCE SOUND HAD LED HIM TO OBSERVE THEM
anonymous0155-20081116-pfp-b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
anonymous0155-20081116-pfp-b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
anonymous0155-20081116-pfp-b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
anonymous0155-20081116-pfp-b0072 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
anonymous0155-20081116-pfp-b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
anonymous0208-20090606-yyv-rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
anonymous0208-20090606-yyv-rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
anonymous0208-20090606-yyv-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
anonymous0208-20090606-yyv-rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
anonymous0208-20090606-yyv-rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
anonymous0208-20090606-yyv-rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
anonymous0208-20090606-yyv-rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
anonymous0208-20090606-yyv-rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
anonymous0208-20090606-yyv-rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
anonymous0208-20090606-yyv-rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
anonymous0226-20090711-zoe-b0264 BUT THIS TIME IT WAS SAXON WHO REBELLED
anonymous0226-20090711-zoe-b0265 I WAS NOT TO CRY OUT IN THE FACE OF FEAR
anonymous0226-20090711-zoe-b0266 AND NOW PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT
anonymous0226-20090711-zoe-b0267 THE BOY THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH PRIDE
anonymous0226-20090711-zoe-b0268 SAXON NODDED AND THE BOY FROWNED
anonymous0226-20090711-zoe-b0269 WHY NOT LIKE ANY RAILROAD STATION OR FERRY DEPOT
anonymous0226-20090711-zoe-b0270 WE COULD THROW STONES WITH OUR FEET
anonymous0226-20090711-zoe-b0271 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A CASUAL HELTER SKELTER SORT OF WAY
anonymous0226-20090711-zoe-b0272 THESE WERE MERELY STOUT STICKS AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMETER
anonymous0226-20090711-zoe-b0273 THEN IT WAS THAT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
anonymous0325-20091220-ijn-rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
anonymous0325-20091220-ijn-rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
anonymous0325-20091220-ijn-rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
anonymous0325-20091220-ijn-rp-16 THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
anonymous0325-20091220-ijn-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
anonymous0325-20091220-ijn-rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
anonymous0325-20091220-ijn-rp-19 THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
anonymous0325-20091220-ijn-rp-20 THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
anonymous0325-20091220-ijn-rp-21 REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
anonymous0325-20091220-ijn-rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
anonymous0371-20100203-ssd-a0541 THE WARDEN WITH A QUART OF CHAMPAGNE
anonymous0371-20100203-ssd-a0542 WITHOUT A DOUBT SOME OF THEM HAVE DINNER ENGAGEMENTS
anonymous0371-20100203-ssd-a0543 I HAD BEEN BORN WITH NO ORGANIC CHEMICAL PREDISPOSITION TOWARD ALCOHOL
anonymous0371-20100203-ssd-a0544 HE MAY ANTICIPATE THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
anonymous0371-20100203-ssd-a0545 THE ITALIAN RANCHO WAS A BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT
anonymous0371-20100203-ssd-a0546 I LOST MY BALANCE AND PITCHED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE OOZE
anonymous0371-20100203-ssd-a0547 MEN LIKE JOE GOOSE DATED EXISTENCE FROM DRUNK TO DRUNK
anonymous0371-20100203-ssd-a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
anonymous0371-20100203-ssd-a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
anonymous0371-20100203-ssd-a0550 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE
anonymous0434-20100505-bxv-b0080 TOMORROW IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND UPON
anonymous0434-20100505-bxv-b0081 YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE AFTER YOU SAW ME ON THE ROCK
anonymous0434-20100505-bxv-b0082 HE BIT HIS TONGUE AND CURSED HIMSELF AT THIS FRESH BREAK
anonymous0434-20100505-bxv-b0083 IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALMOST TRAGEDY
anonymous0434-20100505-bxv-b0084 YOUR FACE IS RED WITH BLOOD
anonymous0434-20100505-bxv-b0085 HER EYES SMILED TRUTH AT HIM AS HE CAME UP THE BANK
anonymous0434-20100505-bxv-b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
anonymous0434-20100505-bxv-b0087 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
anonymous0434-20100505-bxv-b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
anonymous0434-20100505-bxv-b0089 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
anonymous0541-20100821-gbt-b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
anonymous0541-20100821-gbt-b0460 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
anonymous0541-20100821-gbt-b0461 BY VIRTUE OF THAT POWER WE SHALL REMAIN IN POWER
anonymous0541-20100821-gbt-b0462 ONE GUESS WILL DO ERNEST RETORTED
anonymous0541-20100821-gbt-b0463 TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACCEPT THE VACATION
anonymous0541-20100821-gbt-b0464 I COULD NOT AGREE WITH ERNEST
anonymous0541-20100821-gbt-b0465 BUT SUCH DIVERGENCE OF NO MENACE TO SOCIETY
anonymous0541-20100821-gbt-b0466 IT IS DOG EAT DOG AND YOU ATE THEM UP
anonymous0541-20100821-gbt-b0467 LET US RUN THEM FOR OURSELVES
anonymous0541-20100821-gbt-b0468 IT WAS INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE DICK OF OHIO
anonymous0615-20110112-ahi-b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
anonymous0615-20110112-ahi-b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
anonymous0615-20110112-ahi-b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
anonymous0615-20110112-ahi-b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
anonymous0615-20110112-ahi-b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
anonymous0615-20110112-ahi-b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
anonymous0615-20110112-ahi-b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
anonymous0615-20110112-ahi-b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
anonymous0615-20110112-ahi-b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
anonymous0615-20110112-ahi-b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
anonymous0762-20111028-uvj-b0002 YOU GOT OUT BY FIGHTING AND I THROUGH A PRETTY GIRL
anonymous0762-20111028-uvj-b0003 I CAN SEE THAT KNIFE NOW
anonymous0762-20111028-uvj-b0004 WHEN I CAN'T SEE BEAUTY IN WOMAN I WANT TO DIE
anonymous0762-20111028-uvj-b0005 HIS SLIM FINGERS CLOSED LIKE STEEL ABOUT PHILIP'S
anonymous0762-20111028-uvj-b0006 HE SEIZED GREGSON BY THE ARM AND LED HIM TO THE DOOR
anonymous0762-20111028-uvj-b0007 HEAR THE INDIAN DOGS WAILING DOWN AT CHURCHILL
anonymous0762-20111028-uvj-b0008 BURKE HIMSELF HAD CRITICIZED IT BECAUSE OF THE SMILE
anonymous0762-20111028-uvj-b0009 I'D SAY THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GLORIOUS SCRAP
anonymous0762-20111028-uvj-b0010 HE TURNED THE MAP TO GREGSON POINTING WITH HIS FINGER
anonymous0762-20111028-uvj-b0011 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
anonymous0890-20120430-tej-b0051 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
anonymous0890-20120430-tej-b0052 THE FLUSH WAS GONE FROM HER FACE
anonymous0890-20120430-tej-b0053 THAT IS WHY I AM AM RATTLED HE LAUGHED
anonymous0890-20120430-tej-b0054 HE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE LOOK
anonymous0890-20120430-tej-b0055 SHE WAS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WHEN I SAW HER BEFORE
anonymous0890-20120430-tej-b0056 I'LL GIVE A THOUSAND IF YOU PRODUCE HER RETORTED GREGSON
anonymous0890-20120430-tej-b0057 THEY HAVE WON POPULAR SENTIMENT THROUGH THE NEWSPAPERS
anonymous0890-20120430-tej-b0058 WE MUST ACHIEVE OUR OWN SALVATION
anonymous0890-20120430-tej-b0059 IN MOMENTS OF MENTAL ENERGY PHILIP WAS RESTLESS
anonymous0890-20120430-tej-b0060 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
anonymous0913-20120609-kgq-a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
anonymous0913-20120609-kgq-a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
anonymous0913-20120609-kgq-a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
anonymous0913-20120609-kgq-a0171 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
anonymous0913-20120609-kgq-a0172 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
anonymous0913-20120609-kgq-a0173 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
anonymous0913-20120609-kgq-a0174 THEY WERE THE PRESAGE OF STORM
anonymous0913-20120609-kgq-a0175 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
anonymous0913-20120609-kgq-a0176 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
anonymous0913-20120609-kgq-a0177 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
anonymous0989-20121113-jbs-a0361 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
anonymous0989-20121113-jbs-a0362 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
anonymous0989-20121113-jbs-a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
anonymous0989-20121113-jbs-a0364 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
anonymous0989-20121113-jbs-a0365 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
anonymous0989-20121113-jbs-a0366 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
anonymous0989-20121113-jbs-a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
anonymous0989-20121113-jbs-a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
anonymous0989-20121113-jbs-a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
anonymous0989-20121113-jbs-a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
anonymous1023-20130123-jta-b0013 LAKES AND RIVERS HUNDREDS OF THEM THOUSANDS OF THEM
anonymous1023-20130123-jta-b0014 WHITEFISH GREGSON WHITEFISH AND TROUT
anonymous1023-20130123-jta-b0015 THEY ROBBED ME A FEW YEARS LATER
anonymous1023-20130123-jta-b0016 HE CHUCKLED AS HE PULLED OUT HIS PIPE AND BEGAN FILLING IT
anonymous1023-20130123-jta-b0017 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
anonymous1023-20130123-jta-b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
anonymous1023-20130123-jta-b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
anonymous1023-20130123-jta-b0020 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
anonymous1023-20130123-jta-b0021 PHILIP DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
anonymous1023-20130123-jta-b0022 IF I WAS OUT OF THE GAME IT WOULD BE EASILY MADE
anonymous1116-20131221-urh-a0038 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
anonymous1116-20131221-urh-a0039 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
anonymous1116-20131221-urh-a0040 I SUPPOSE YOU WONDER WHY SHE IS COMING UP HERE
anonymous1116-20131221-urh-a0041 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
anonymous1116-20131221-urh-a0042 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
anonymous1116-20131221-urh-a0043 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
anonymous1116-20131221-urh-a0044 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
anonymous1116-20131221-urh-a0045 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
anonymous1116-20131221-urh-a0046 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
anonymous1116-20131221-urh-a0047 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF DOG
anonymous1184-20150109-mlr-b0174 HATRED AND MURDER AND LUST FOR REVENGE THEY POSSESSED TO OVERFLOWING
anonymous1184-20150109-mlr-b0175 SHELDON GLANCED AT THE THERMOMETER
anonymous1184-20150109-mlr-b0176 I'LL SEE TO POOR HUGHIE
anonymous1184-20150109-mlr-b0177 HER GRAY EYES WERE FLASHING AND HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING
